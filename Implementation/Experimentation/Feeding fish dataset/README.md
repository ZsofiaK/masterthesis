# MARINE for the feeding fish dataset

The feeding fish dataset is a custom (unpublished) dataset recorded by members of the Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Amsterdam.

The MARINE model (with some modifications) was applied to it in a task to determine when the fish in the videos were feeding or not (a binary classification task).

As the setup of this dataset is slightly different than those of coral reef and AK fish, this experiment was not eventually included in the thesis paper.
