# Contents
The thesis concerns action recognition to identify fish predator attacks in untrimmed video footage.

This repository includes directories related to the implementation of the project.

## Programming exercise
The directory includes the implementation of a programming exercise aimed to kick-off the learning process of the technical aspects of the project.

## Tutorials
The directory includes completed notebooks of tutorials related to Python libraries used in the study.

## Implementation
The directory includes the following sub-folders:

### EDA
The directory includes material related to Exploratory Data Analysis on the used datasets, most importantly Animal Kingdom (https://github.com/sutdcv/Animal-Kingdom).

### Experimentation
The directory includes pilot notebooks and script for testing the modules used in the final pipeline.

### Modules
The directory includes a collection of custom modules used in the pipeline.

### Pipeline
The directory includes notebook relating to each step of the pipeline (frame selection, feature extraction, action recognition).

### Additional directories
Auxilliary directories including generated figures and assets relating to the used datasets.
